Current TODO list, broken into things which are relevant for the
initramfs itself (/init et al) vs the generator

INITRAMFS TODO
--------------
* Currently, our switch_root command uses nash's switchroot.  Getting
a reasonable switchroot implementation into util-linux-ng is a
pre-condition for support on other distros.  pjones has a basic
implementation at
http://pjones.fedorapeople.org/mkstart/usr/lib/mkstart/switchroot.c
and I've asked kzak about util-linux inclusion
* The hard-coded list of udev rules that we care about is kind of
lame.  See about getting /lib/udev/initrules.d or similar for storing
the rules that we care about in the initramfs.  These could be
symlinks/hardlinks to the main rules in some cases or special-cased
ones
* LVM activation by udev is a bit of a large hammer right now
* dm-crypt (luks) depends on plymouth
* plymouth is hard-coded... this may be reasonable as modesetting goes
into the upstream kernel as a way to get off of fb-splash stuff, but I
can see this being a point of contention for other distros
  * plymouth --show-splash should be done as a udev rule so that we
  can switch modes first
* root= parsing should be done with udev creating /dev/root symlink
for us appropriately
* Support thaw (resume from hibernate)
* Currently requires the drop-nash branch of plymouth; get merged into
master and released
* Proving some support with a simple network based root would be good
  * Do we just call dhclient, etc or try to get NetworkManager going?
* Would be nice not to have to kill and restart udev across switchroot 
* mdraid
* dmraid
* multipath
* SELinux policy either needs to be loaded from the initramfs or /init
on the rootfs



GENERATOR TODO
--------------
* Needs to be written to look at the current kernel and get the
modules so it can be used on a running system.
* Move the needed pieces of Fedora mkinitrd's initrd-functions into
this tree.  This should mainly be around shlib resolution/copying at
present
* We should just grab appropriate modules rather than all of them.
  * Should default to basically all storage drivers, possibly allow to
  specify less
  * Maybe use class based specifiers (=ata, =net, etc) that we do
  today with Fedora mkinitrd
* Certainly more as this is a huge hack right now
