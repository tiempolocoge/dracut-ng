Current TODO list, broken into things which are relevant for the initramfs itself (/init et al) vs the generator. A lot of things are/should be marked with "FIXME" in the code
INITRAMFS TODO

- The hard-coded list of udev rules that we care about is kind of lame.
- automatic kexec fallback
- panic fallback
- fsck for $NEWROOT/usr

GENERATOR TODO

- Default module specification could use some work
- udev rule copying, as mentioned above, is a bit too hard-coded
- pkg-config integration, to make it easy for other packages to use us.
- add recovery image creator (mkrecovery)

CODE TODO
- document functions
- make function vars local, and prefix with "_"

Future Enhancement Requests

- run ssh server to enter crypto password or perform debugging (supported by debian)
- Bug 524727 - Dracut + encrypted root + networking
