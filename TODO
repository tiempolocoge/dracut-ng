Current TODO list, broken into things which are relevant for the
initramfs itself (/init et al) vs the generator.  A lot of things
are/should be marked with "FIXME" in the code

INITRAMFS TODO
--------------
* The hard-coded list of udev rules that we care about is kind of
lame.  See about getting /lib/udev/initrules.d or similar for storing
the rules that we care about in the initramfs.  These could be
symlinks/hardlinks to the main rules in some cases or special-cased
ones
* LVM activation by udev is a bit of a large hammer right now
* root= parsing should be done with udev creating /dev/root symlink
for us appropriately
* Proving some support with a simple network based root would be good
  * Do we just call dhclient, etc or try to get NetworkManager going?
* Would be nice not to have to kill and restart udev across switchroot 
* mdraid 
* dmraid newer versions will be completly event based
* multipath
* Should SELinux policy be done in the initramfs or from the real
rootfs?
* Keyboard layout/consolefont setup is Fedora/RHEL-specific.  
* iSCSI
* NFS, NBD
* parse root parameters from DHCP
* s390

GENERATOR TODO
--------------
* Default module specificatoin could use some work
* udev rule copying, as mentioned above, is a bit too hard-coded
* pkg-config integration, to make it easy for other packages to use us.
* Autotool-izing the package is probably overkill, but making the Makefile
  vaguely autotools-compatible and adding a configure script would probably
  be a good thing.


Special cases to revisit later
------------------------------
* livecd (/ on dm-snapshot over ext3 on squashfs on iso9660)
* installer
* kdump 

Other tasks performed by the initrd other than mounting rootfs 
--------------------------------------------------------------
*  restore from hibernate
* kdump
* Loading initial SELinux policy. 


Future Enhancement Requests
---------------------------

Note that our main concern, especially right now, is proving viability of some of the ideas and then showing it with the things that we already support. If things work out, then it should be doable to start putting in support for new things that we don't already have support for. Nothing in this list is guaranteed but if people have ideas about new things, put them here and they'll at least be considered.

* run ssh server to enter crypto password or perform debugging (supported by debian)
* Make it possible to easily extend the initramfs, e.g. by packages that provide additional features to the initramfs, e.g. an ssh server (partly? supported by initramfs-tools in debian. e.g. with /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks)
* Hook in overlay filesystem like aufs/unionfs (necessary for Debian/Ubuntu LTSP and LiveCD etc.)
* switchroot without re-running daemons like udev again (not sure if this is possible)
