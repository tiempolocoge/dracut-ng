Current TODO list, broken into things which are relevant for the
initramfs itself (/init et al) vs the generator.  A lot of things
are/should be marked with "FIXME" in the code

INITRAMFS TODO
--------------
* The hard-coded list of udev rules that we care about is kind of
lame.  See about getting /lib/udev/initrules.d or similar for storing
the rules that we care about in the initramfs.  These could be
symlinks/hardlinks to the main rules in some cases or special-cased
ones
* LVM activation by udev is a bit of a large hammer right now
* root= parsing should be done with udev creating /dev/root symlink
for us appropriately
* Proving some support with a simple network based root would be good
  * Do we just call dhclient, etc or try to get NetworkManager going?
* Would be nice not to have to kill and restart udev across switchroot 
* mdraid
* dmraid
* multipath
* Should SELinux policy be done in the initramfs or from the real
rootfs?
* Keyboard layout/consolefont setup is Fedora/RHEL-specific.  


GENERATOR TODO
--------------
* Default module specificatoin could use some work
* udev rule copying, as mentioned above, is a bit too hard-coded
* pkg-config integration, to make it easy for other packages to use us.
* Autotool-izing the package is probably overkill, but making the Makefile
  vaguely autotools-compatible and adding a configure script would probably
  be a good thing.
