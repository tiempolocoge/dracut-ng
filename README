This is the simple skeleton of a new initrd infrastructure.
Information about our goals and aims can be found at

One of the biggest goals is that we're using common pieces from the
system as much as possible and we also want to do this in a way that
can eventually get some cross-distro buy-in.  But for now, it's a
playground to see what of our ideas are actually feasible.
